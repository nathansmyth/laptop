--------
Here's where I wanna start, when I come back around to this.
crew
* [project page](http://skycocker.github.io/chromebrew/)
* [packages list](https://github.com/skycocker/chromebrew/tree/master/packages)

crouton
* [crouton cookbook](http://tomwwolf.com/chromebook-14-compedium/chromebook-crouton-cookbook/)
* [github repo](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton)


Requirements
------------

We support:

* [HP Chromebook 14](http://store.hp.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/us/en/mdp/Laptops/chromebook-14)

Other versions may work but aren't tested. Bug reports for older
versions are welcome.

Install
-------

Download, review, then execute the script:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nathansmyth/laptop/master/chromebook
less chromebook
sh chromebook
```

What it sets up
---------------

* [Bundler] for managing Ruby libraries
* [Node.js] and [NPM], for running apps and installing JavaScript packages
* [Zsh] as your shell

[Bundler]: http://bundler.io/
[Node.js]: http://nodejs.org/
[NPM]: https://www.npmjs.org/
[Zsh]: http://www.zsh.org/

It should take less than 15 minutes to install (depends on your machine).
